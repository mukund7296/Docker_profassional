# Docker Fundamentals - Course Overview

Welcome to the **Docker Fundamentals** course, a beginner-friendly introduction to Docker, designed to get you up and running with this powerful containerization tool in under two hours. This course, taught by software engineer Carlos Nunez, covers the basics of Docker, its use cases, and practical skills for creating and managing containers.



## Course Overview

In software development, it’s common for applications to run smoothly on one machine but face issues on others. Traditional solutions include using configuration management tools and virtual machines, which can be complex and time-consuming. Docker provides a simplified alternative by packaging applications into standardized, portable containers.

### What You Will Learn
This course will guide you through:
1. **Docker Basics**: Understanding what Docker is and common scenarios where it’s beneficial.
2. **Containers vs. Virtual Machines**: Key differences and advantages of using containers.
3. **Core Technologies in Docker**:
   - **Layered Containers**
   - **Dockerfile**: The blueprint for building Docker images.
   - **Docker API**: Managing containers programmatically.
4. **Building and Managing Containers**: Hands-on practice with Docker CLI to create and control containers.
5. **Creating Custom Images**: Using Dockerfiles to build images tailored to your application.
6. **Docker Registry**: Pushing and managing images in the Docker registry for version control and distribution.
7. **Troubleshooting and Best Practices**: Tips for resolving common container issues and adhering to best practices.
